        Focus: High-energy solar particles
        The CLEAR Center plays a critical role in protecting human spaceflight and spacecraft systems from the dangers
        of solar energetic particles (SEPs). These particles are often released during solar flares and coronal mass
        ejections, traveling at high velocities that allow them to reach Earth and deep-space environments in a short
        time. The center studies how SEPs propagate through interplanetary space and how quickly they can reach
        spacecraft, lunar missions, and Martian transfer orbits.
        One of its primary goals is the development of real-time and near-real-time forecasting models capable of
        issuing early alerts before radiation exposure reaches harmful levels. This includes integrating satellite data,
        solar observatories, and heliophysics simulations to better predict the onset and trajectory of radiation
        storms. CLEAR also collaborates with mission planners to create shielding protocols and exposure response
        strategies for astronauts aboard missions like Artemis, the Lunar Gateway, and future Mars expeditions.
        The center further analyzes how radiation affects sensitive onboard systems such as avionics, communication
        modules, power supplies, and life-support components. It also contributes to defining safe operational windows
        and emergency shelter procedures during solar storms. In addition, CLEAR assists in shaping guidelines for
        spacecraft hardening and instrument calibration to prevent malfunctions caused by energetic particles.
        Another key area of research includes long-term radiation risk modeling, especially for prolonged missions
        outside Earth's magnetosphere. By combining data from previous missions, such as SOHO, Parker Solar Probe, and
        ACE, CLEAR helps refine predictions of SEP frequency and intensity during different solar cycles. The centerâ€™s
        work is essential not only for astronaut health but also for safeguarding satellites, probes, and landers
        operating beyond low Earth orbit.
